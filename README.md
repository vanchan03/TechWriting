Hi! Here are some pieces writing that I've written for various classes in college. 

The Artificial Creativity pieces are part of a two-part series I wrote for my Data Ethics class. I was tasked to write two op-eds about opposing viewpoints of the same issue within AI ethics. 

Surrealist Meme Subculture: Two Paths on Religion is an academic essay I wrote for my Theories and Methods religion class. 
We had to incorporate various economic, sociological, anthropological, and philosophical theories on what religion is to argue that a specific community can be interpreted as a religion.
Naturally, I chose to write about internet memes. I'm really proud of this essay. 

Thanks!
